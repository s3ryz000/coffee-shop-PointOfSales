its what the names says

(Written May 27, 2025)
Hello reader! I hope you are well.

This is my first programming diary entry (and repository).  I have always had a fascination for receipts because of what they report--- what I bought. One day I was just chilling in Starbucks, and had the idea to actually start conceptualizing how they operate from a business information system persepective. Which is why for this 2025 Summer, I plan to build a Coffee Shop POS publicly on GitHub. 

I am using the Java concepts I learned in my sophomore year (2024-2025) of IT, and ChatGPT as a tool to help me learn basic syntax, debugging, and understand not just HOW, but WHY code works that way.

My programming philosophy:
- it doesn't have to be hard, which is why I use a whiteboard and my imagination for Object-Oriented Design
- for me, it helps to visualize and turn concepts into something digestible (like a meme/brainrot)

Take care and be safe!

Sincerely, s3ryz0.
